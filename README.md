## 💡 Tips and Tricks: AI-Assisted Development

* **🧠 Prompting for Logic, not just Code** Instead of asking for the final solution, I prompted the AI to explain the underlying logic of every function in the project.
    
* **🧩 Decomposing Complex Tasks** Following the "Pro Tip" for students, I broke the application into smaller sub-tasks: **Database Schema → Backend Logic → UI Integration**. This made the AI-generated code more accurate and significantly easier to debug.
    
* **🛠️ Iterative Debugging** When encountering errors with the "Antigravity" logic or Firebase sync, I provided the AI with specific error logs to receive targeted refactoring suggestions and optimized code.
    
* **⚠️ Validation & Edge Cases** I used the AI to brainstorm potential edge cases—such as empty task titles or study sessions shorter than one minute—to build robust validation rules within the backend.
    
* **📖 Learning while Coding** I documented the "Why" behind the "How" by asking the AI to compare traditional code snippets with the **Agent-First orchestration** approach.
